# Intro

## The ATF

The Accountability Task-Force **\(ATF\)** is a recurring experiment around the Genesis Alpha DAO from DAOstack. A working group that has the objective of making Genesis more responsible and resilient. It documents and keeps track of what is happening in the Genesis DAO on a weekly basis, to ensure proposal accountability and flag any irregularities that need the attention of the members of DAO. This group intends to increasingly automate its' work and "decentralize" itself over time.

## Rationale

### Our goals

* Keep proposal execution accountable and unofficially signal proposals
* Detect and defend against social attacks on the DAO
* Exchange information with the community while keeping our own work accountable and transparent 

### About Gitbook

We believe that git based solutions represent an important step to more accessible, decentralized and open-source solutions and knowledge production. Gitbook offers an elegant visualization of markdown documents that can freely receive contributions \(including forks\) on Github as well .
