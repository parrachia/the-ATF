## When will my proposal get certified as being a “good proposal”?

In ATF terms, certifying a proposal means very basic quality control on whether a proposal fulfills certain key parameters. Certification or non-certification is not a judgement of the quality of the proposal it terms of its contents.

### Parameters a certified proposals shall include:

* Name and contact info of the proposer \(including adding your identity on Alchemy\)
* Clear deliverables and fair inputs \(= amount of funds/rep/resources\)
* Clear Deadline and/or milestones/checkpoints
* Information on how progress updates will be shared and how the proposer wants to be held accountable
* Documentation after implementation. I.e. tutorials, resources, articles
* It shall be shared with the community:
  * On Discord
  * In the Pollinators Telegram group

## When will my proposal get flagged?

A proposal being flagged does not necessarily mean it is bad, it simply says that it is stuck, stalled and may need help. The purpose of flagging is to enable proposers to get help if needed, or consider pausing, passing along or even giving up on their proposal.

### Parameters for flagging a proposal:

* No contact with proposer after the second attempt
* Late delivery
* Different outcome
* Bad delivery
* No delivery

### When a proposal is flagged, it is communicated in 3 different places:

* ATF’s channel on Discord
* [Proposals tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FV8iz4ebZb4E3nXckzPsWy7IfhtsX3filkbX_gbPLNs/edit#gid=1504108070) under “blocks”
* [ATF’s certified and flagged proposals map](https://coggle.it/diagram/W7MUdTXvFIp-21YB/t/the-atf-logs/560bd637afa90aa8cbdd56dc50d877bb6e2a18c4554d395c64f4f4aecf020172)
