# 1st Proposal - Experimenting with the Accountability Network

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U2-FE0bt9p1Cn2H\_-fYxB7oybcDH7WlHhcMj0b20sgI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U2-FE0bt9p1Cn2H_-fYxB7oybcDH7WlHhcMj0b20sgI/edit?usp=sharing)[​source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U2-FE0bt9p1Cn2H_-fYxB7oybcDH7WlHhcMj0b20sgI/edit?usp=sharing)

**Short Pitch:** Create the first positions in an off-chain self-regulatory group designed to make Genesis more responsible and resilient.

**Promoting Genesis Alpha’s purpose:**

1. Alignment: DAOstack’s success depends on our ability to create DAOs that act in alignment with members’ wishes. The ATF can help align Genesis and show future DAOs how to do the same.

2. Smooth, Safe Launch: With a public call for Genesis Proposals looming, we want to make sure the DAO can handle lots of traffic, do what it sets out to do, and defend potential dangerous behaviors.  


**Funds requested:** 20 ETH \(4/month for Defense Officer, 3/month for Proposal Accountability Officers for two months, distributed by the target of this proposal.\)  


**Reputation requested:** 0 \(Anyone may submit a proposal later to reward the ATF officers with reputation for their work.\)

### Deliverables

The ATF is expected to produce these concrete deliverables.  


**Proposal Accountability Officers \(2\):**

1. Policy document describing the requirements for ATF certification
2. Log of submitted proposals, their respective budgets, and whether or not they have been certified
3. Log of passed proposals with updates on progress and completion

**Defense Officer:**

1. Reports included in the ATF Updates \(see below\) on any possible attacks that have been detected or simulated
2. Proposals submitted to defend against attacks
3. \(Optional\) Proposals submitted to simulate or research new possible attack paths

### Detailed Description

This proposal creates a budget for 3 people to start an Accountability Task Force \(ATF\). The ATF will start with 2 jobs:

1. Two Proposal Accountability Officers, who …

… keep proposal execution accountable. Create and publish a running list of passed proposals and who received funds to execute them; check in and inform the DAO on their progress and completion. This should include the ATF proposal itself!

… create guidelines for proposal writing and unofficially "certify" proposals that meet those standards, e.g. to get certified, a proposal must have a short pitch, a justification statement, and a deliverables list.

1. A Defense Officer, who…

… detects and defends social attacks on the DAO, such as a bombardment of identical boosted proposals, a group of addresses aiming to loot the DAO, etc. Responds to attacks by either \(a\) creating and implementing DAOstack elements to prevent such attacks, or \(b\) creating proposals that manipulate reputation to mitigate the attack.

… simulates attacks and reports results, either by executing a fake attack themselves or creating proposals to find others to help.

… develops a response playbook, with a list of possible attacks and the DAO’s planned responses. The Defense Officer is also largely responsible for executing those plans, but this will be a good resource to have for the future. Publish the playbook via Alchemy proposal to get DAO approval.

Together, the officers should also ...

… schedule regular ATF meetings \(once a month, or in the event of an emergency\), which are open to all Genesis members to attend. The officers should be plainly recognizable, wearing a [hat, badge, or special identifying insignia](http://www.1860-1960.com/xh0295p0.jpg), of a silly or nonchalant character. In these meetings, the officers

* exchange information,
  * Are there any strange reputation or proposal behaviors going on that the Defense Officer should be aware of? Does member participation reflect the success or failure to execute a tracked proposal?
* write “ATF Updates” for the DAO,
  * The officers should take notes on each meeting and link them in the Genesis Discord as official ATF Updates.
* and take member questions.
  * Each meeting should have some time when community members can ask ATF officers questions.

… manage moderation of the public Discord channels. Once the public call for proposals goes out, we anticipate lots of activity in a public Discord channel. The ATF officers will be responsible for designing moderation policies, appointing moderators from the community, and demoting moderators via ATF vote.

In designing policies, ATF officers are expected to incorporate the DAO’s feedback, mostly by passing the policies in actual Alchemy proposals with budgets of 0.

### People and Timeline

**People:**

Proposal Accountability Officers: Parrachia \(long time community member and pollinator, blockchain ecology researcher\), Zahler \(coming on Parachia’s recommendation, distributed governance researcher and Holochain community facilitator in Brazil\)

**Proposal prepared by:** Pat and Ezra  


People employed by DAOstack, LTD cannot be ATF officers.

**Timeline:** 3 people working 5 hours a week for 1 month starting with the passing of this proposal.
