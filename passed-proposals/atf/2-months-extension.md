# 2 months extension

Short Pitch: [the Accountability Task Force experiment was launched 2 months ago](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U2-FE0bt9p1Cn2H_-fYxB7oybcDH7WlHhcMj0b20sgI/edit) aiming at creating the first positions on- and off-chain self-regulatory group designed to make Genesis more responsible and resilient. We’d like to extend and refine this experiment.

Promoting Genesis Alpha’s purposes are:

1. Alignment: DAOstack’s success depends on our ability to create DAOs that act in alignment with members’ goals. The ATF can help align GenesisDAO and create precedence forfuture DAOs.

2. Smooth, Safe Launch: With a public call for Genesis Proposals looming, we want to make sure the DAO can handle lots of traffic, do what it sets out to do, and defend potential dangerous behaviors.

#### During past 2 months the ATF:

Submitted the following deliverables:

* Agreement for new pollinators default reputation request: proposed and enforced a soft cap of 100 REP as reference for new pollinators
* Proposals Lifecycles
* [A kanban board for Genesis+ATF](https://trello.com/b/z5N5Bsru/daostack-atf): Set up a Trello tracking the ATF’s actions for reference and transparency
* [Proposals Tracking:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FV8iz4ebZb4E3nXckzPsWy7IfhtsX3filkbX_gbPLNs/edit) Built a spreadsheet summarizing all proposals so far in Genesis  DAO
* and more [\[see ATF’s Trello\]](https://trello.com/b/z5N5Bsru/daostack-atf)

Started the following research:

* Reputation Decay Mechanisms
* DAO Defense Protocol
* DAO Accountability Heuristics
* DAO Attack Alert Response
* Systematic Review of Accountability structures on other DLTs / DGov initiatives
* Proposal tracking automation
* and more [\[see ATF’s Trello\]](https://trello.com/b/z5N5Bsru/daostack-atf)

#### New objectives for the next 2 months are:

1. Implement the ATF Flagging and certifying MVP proposal mechanism and set in motion automations  

2. Implement an Hourglass Proposal mechanism.

3. Implement defensive measures in view of Genesis Beta:

1. Complete emergency procedure protocol with contact list;
2. Research to implement DAO emergency fund repatriation mechanism \(like a dead man’s switch\)

4. Continuing previous responsibilities:

1. keep proposal execution accountable
2. detect and defend against social attacks on the DAO
3. simulates attacks and reports results
4. develop documentation
5. regular ATF meetings

5. [Make the ATF obsolete](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17vqNVAAFMibjG-M6Up7kieka4fxDHVZVmaogAnR_uuY/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Deliverables

The ATF is expected to produce these concrete deliverables.

Proposal Accountability Officers \(up to 3\):

1. Policy document describing the requirements for ATF certification

2. Log of submitted proposals, their respective budgets, and whether or not they have been certified or flagged

3. Log of passed proposals with updates on progress and completion

Defense Officer \(at least 1\):

1. Reports included in the ATF Updates \(see below\) on any possible attacks that have been detected or simulated

2. Proposals submitted to defend against attacks

3. Proposals submitted to simulate or research new possible attack paths

4.   Policy documents regarding the DAO Defense

#### Funds requested:

50 ETH budget overall for two months. This budget will be allocated monthly by ATF members based on their collaborative decision-making and the work each officer has delivered. If the budget is not used up after the 2 months, the remaining ETH will be returned to the DAO; if it is used up earlier, the ATF will submit a new proposal. Each officer will receive a minimum of  3 ETH per month.

Reputation requested: 0

\(Anyone may submit a proposal later to reward the ATF officers with reputation for their work.\)
