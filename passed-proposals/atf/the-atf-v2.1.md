# The ATF v2.1

Step by step from a Task Force to  
a Decentralized Accountability NetworK \(DANK\)

Proposal by Pedro, Francesca, Daniel, Dmitry

Date: 15.12.2018 \| Delivery to begin 01.01.2019  


**Context**  


[The ATF was launched 3 months ago](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U2-FE0bt9p1Cn2H_-fYxB7oybcDH7WlHhcMj0b20sgI/edit) and submitted its’ [second proposal here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TlnbJ4mgptsl6YuTdt4X5m0MUI8XD_fCGphT8k7zU5o/edit#heading=h.2jz38opf40l5). This is a new version of this second proposal, which takes into account key feedback from the community. Consequently, the ATF is putting forward a new format for structuring and funding its work:

1. Recurring work \(tracking, reporting, moderation\)
2. Reactive work \(defense, flagging & certifying, assisting\)
3. Research & Development \(researching, testing, improving\)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


The Accountability Task Force aims to continue creating the first positions in an off-chain self-regulatory group designed to make Genesis more responsible and resilient.  
  


This Proposal

To ensure clarity and ease of tracking deliverables, as of now, ATF proposals will focus on the recurring and reactive work, separating R&D entirely. instead of mixing them all together \(as was done in previous proposals\).  


We are proposing for a one month retainer for “maintenance” work, for the recurring and reactive tasks listed below. The ATF intends to continuously fund these activities on a per-month basis \(for now\). The proposed budget is based on estimates of fiat-based, market hourly rates, which means that volatility of ETH may affect the amount that can be delivered month by month.  


R&D projects will be funded independently and on a one-off basis.  
  


Notes: until mid January 2019, DAOstack is directly funding monthly proposal tracking and a summary report. This proposal covers the time period after this is over, which is why proposal trackings is included below.  
  
  
  
  


| Accountability Officers | Defense officer |
| :--- | :--- |
| Keep proposal execution accountable and unofficially signal proposals . Based on the running list of passed proposals and their status,  the ATF will signal \(with flags and certifications\) proposals and inform the DAO on their progress and completion \(e.g. to get certified, a proposal must have a short pitch, a justification statement, and a deliverables list and so on\). | Detects and defends social attacks on the DAO, such as a bombardment of identical boosted proposals, a group of addresses aiming to loot the DAO, etc. Responds to attacks by either \(a\) creating and implementing DAOstack elements to prevent such attacks, or \(b\) creating proposals that manipulate reputation to mitigate the attack. |

#### Deliverables

Accountability Officers \(up to 3\):

1. Proposal tracking: Weekly updated [log of passed proposals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FV8iz4ebZb4E3nXckzPsWy7IfhtsX3filkbX_gbPLNs/edit#gid=1504108070) with updates on progress and completion \| 1 hour weekly
2. Proposal signaling [\(certifying and flagging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11OBW8xY9a_h1s4Ktd-RDA6jPrRfdGim2JaAaqq1n3WY/edit?usp=sharing)\): interact with proposers, assist and signal accordingly \| 3 hours weekly
3. Monthly summary report of Genesis Proposals, [see here](https://daotalk.org/t/genesis-alpha-proposals-reports/321/3) \| 3 hours

Defense Officer \(at least 1\) \| \| 2 hours weekly

1. Regular monitoring of the DAO for unusual behavior with flagging for the pollinator’s attention and action in case of highly suspicious activity
2. Report relevant episodes \(attacks, simulations, other signallings\)

Team coordination:

1. Hold open, weekly, 30-min ATF meetings \(and additional ones in an emergency\) \| 30 min / week / person
   1. exchange information: Are there any strange reputation or proposal behaviors going on? Does member participation reflect the success or failure to execute a tracked proposal?
   2. update public [kanban board](https://trello.com/b/z5N5Bsru/genesisdao-atf): as a way to keep the ATF work accountable, sharing updates on discord and/or forum when relevant
   3. take member questions: each meeting should have some time when community members can ask ATF officers questions.

#### Budget

#### 19 ETH budget for ~ 35 hours of work \(calculated at 60 € per hour\) within 1 month. This budget will be allocated by ATF members based on their collaborative decision-making and the work each officer has delivered.

| Task | Hours | Budget |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Weekly ATF calls with all officers, Kanban & feedback to Genesis | 8 | 480 € |
| Proposal Tracking & Monthly Reports | 7 | 420 € |
| Proposal Certifying & Flagging | 12 | 720 € |
| Defense Monitoring and Reports | 8 | 480 € |
| TOTAL | 35 | 2100 € |

TOTAL in EUR: 2.100 €, in ETH: 20  


Reputation requested: 0

\(Anyone may submit a proposal later to reward the ATF officers with reputation for their work.\)

#### Team

Accountability Officers:

* Pedro \(long time community member and pollinator, blockchain ecology researcher\),
* Francesca \(Genesis Pilot Facilitator, Collaborative Governance Consultant through Greaterthan\)
* Dmitry \(active pollinator\)

Defense Officer:

* Daniel \(@cryptodani, long time pollinator, DAO Incubator, crypto-economic and decentralized governance research and advisory\)

#### Research and Development

From the feedback we received during the voting process of the [\[ATF extension proposal\]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TlnbJ4mgptsl6YuTdt4X5m0MUI8XD_fCGphT8k7zU5o/edit?usp=sharing), we understood that breaking down our proposed work in smaller pieces is preferable.

As described above, we decided to split recurring and reactive tasks from R&D \(policy and mechanism design propositions mostly\). While the scope of this proposal document regards the 1st part, we’d also like to briefly describe some of the things we plan to propose separately:  
  


Accountability  


1. Continuously improve policy around [flagging & certifying](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11OBW8xY9a_h1s4Ktd-RDA6jPrRfdGim2JaAaqq1n3WY/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Automations for [proposal tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FV8iz4ebZb4E3nXckzPsWy7IfhtsX3filkbX_gbPLNs/edit#gid=1504108070)
3. Decentralization of signalings \([flags and certifications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11OBW8xY9a_h1s4Ktd-RDA6jPrRfdGim2JaAaqq1n3WY/edit?usp=sharing)\) - metamoderation mostly
4. Badges?
5. Investigate Reputation Decay Mechanisms \(e.g. [Borrowing models](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ml4jw4bWlje8HQCgcEupRj1gK8KOWDPoJ9KklJbnnAs/edit?usp=sharing)\)
6. DAO Accountability Heuristics - rules of thumb for easier and more engaging responsible use of Alchemy
7. Systematic Review of Accountability structures on some other DLTs / DGov initiatives
8. Eventual transition from a Task Force to the Decentralized Accountability NetworK \(DANK\) inside the DAO - a process to make the ATF obsolete by empowering the community with sufficient tools and processes
9. Implement the [Hourglass Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L2fqSjGy806pxcZ5EkmH5EspJVpsCUiOq1Od27Qea8g/edit) mechanism - even if in a simulated scenario
10. Scaffolding screening practices - as in helping people find and understand the knowledge and data that agents need to participate on Genesis. Assistive developments on the other side of risk assessments.  

  
Defense  


1. Ad-hoc research proposals designed to guide behavior in case of an attack
2. a\)[Emergency procedures](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u3kRsXsigK-zntM8A1PkwQPQpPNhOkPMjklgUYgeZ84/edit) stable version

               b\)[DAO Defense Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_99skdvorcwPZllm97bOSak4LSn0z6GtbjSjD9jT4Ao/edit?usp=sharing) continual development

1. Ad-hoc Proposals submitted to defend against attacks \(arbitrage, automatic dao alerts, research proposals\)
2. Investigate Reputation Decay Mechanisms

From competition to cooperation
