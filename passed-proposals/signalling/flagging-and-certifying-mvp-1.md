# Flagging and certifying MVP

[source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11OBW8xY9a_h1s4Ktd-RDA6jPrRfdGim2JaAaqq1n3WY/edit?usp=sharing)

The intention of this document is to propose an opt-out system, where every proposal is included unless disclosed otherwise. The opt-out system goal is to help proposers make themselves more accountable and working towards a better DAO, a better Genesis DAO Apha Program and maybe even a better Alchemy.

Both system and document are on alpha stage “\*\*\*play at your own risk\*\*\*”

### Certification \(pre\)

#### Why

This is long overdue and already approved on [the ATF proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xa3f5411cfc9eee0dd108bf0d07433b6dd99037f1/proposal/0x9ceee8f327726e8b3ea7de47d4fff468008f539b630427c642124b539073a0e8). TLDR; Create the first positions in an off-chain self-regulatory group designed to make Genesis more responsible and resilient.  


We from the ATF believe that this can help us all write clearer proposals which will help us become more accountable.

#### How

Certifying or merely saying “hey, according to those previously consensuated parameters, your proposal is pretty good!”  


Certifying here means arbitrary Quality Control, checking the proposal document \(analogous to a Letter of Commitment\) for:

* Clear outcomes and fair inputs  
* Deadline and/or checkpoints \(+ contact info!\)
* Documentation

And published on 3 different places

* ATF’s channel on Discord
* [Proposals tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FV8iz4ebZb4E3nXckzPsWy7IfhtsX3filkbX_gbPLNs/edit?usp=sharing)
* [ATF’s certified and flagged proposals map](https://coggle.it/diagram/W7MUdTXvFIp-21YB/t/the-atf-logs/560bd637afa90aa8cbdd56dc50d877bb6e2a18c4554d395c64f4f4aecf020172)

#### What

But what does it look like? Depends where:

* On Discord, for now, literally like described earlier + “thus it is certified”. Or something silly like that
* On the spreadsheet, as one more variable, a simple new column
* On the map a more in depth interaction with key reasons and user friendly tracking

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  


But is this the only way to do things? How lame that’d be.  


Instead, every proposer should be free to choose how to be held accountable. What if Alice don’t recognize the reasoning of the ATF or Bob has an exotic proposal where he himself chooses who should audit it?

In the end it’s up to the community to vote in favor or against. But that’s such a big responsibility that it’d be healthy to invest a future document to outline good practices when voting and campaigning.  
  


### Flagging \(post award\)

#### Why

This is long overdue and already approved on the ATF proposal too. Not only signalling flawless proposals but also signaling when attention and maybe help is needed.

#### How

When things don’t go as planned and a proposal gets flagged, the best thing we could do is offer help. Or else to call for help, to consider pausing, fostering/passing along or even giving up on that unfortunate proposal.  


Simple parameters for flagging:

* No contact
* Late
* Different outcome
* Bad delivery
* No delivery

And published on 3 different places

* ATF’s channel on Discord
* [Proposals tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FV8iz4ebZb4E3nXckzPsWy7IfhtsX3filkbX_gbPLNs/edit?usp=sharing)
* [ATF’s certified and flagged proposals map](https://coggle.it/diagram/W7MUdTXvFIp-21YB/t/the-atf-logs/560bd637afa90aa8cbdd56dc50d877bb6e2a18c4554d395c64f4f4aecf020172)

#### What

But what does it look like? Depends where:

* On Discord, for now, literally like described earlier + “thus it is flagged”. Or something silly like that
* On the spreadsheet, as one more variable, a simple new column
* On the map, a more in depth interaction with key reasons and user friendly tracking

### Exceptions

About stuff outside the scope of this MVP.

Or the proto arbitration module  


1. when small enough we will try to solve it as quickly as possible and never think about that again
2. when not so small we will either consult with whoever we find adequate and/or log it somewhere publicly accessible \(discord/trello/meeting’s log or something else\)
3. then if definitely not small we will make matters public on discord/telegram/weekly-call and decide how to proceed from there
4. if it comes to that, the ATF will formalize the issue into alchemy itself. Probably in the form of an [hourglass proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L2fqSjGy806pxcZ5EkmH5EspJVpsCUiOq1Od27Qea8g/edit?usp=sharing).
5. worse case scenario \(FUBAR\) legal counseling will be considered
