**\# Reflections**

* The majority of the high value open source development contributions are coming from one team of two people
* Bounty programs as incentives are not being taken advantage of much
* People are not submitting to the community blog and reports
* Attendance on Pollinator community calls and telegram is increasing and does not correlate with activity levels on alchemy, discord and bounty program participation
