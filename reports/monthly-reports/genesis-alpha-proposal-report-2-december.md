Here is Genesis Alpha’s second proposal report, to share with you a summary and highlights of proposals in the community of the month of December until today.  


**Highlights**

* December was a comparatively quiet month in the Genesis DAO - probably in part a result of a plummeting ETH price, the holidays and the ATF “episode” \(read more below\)
* Instead of pitching for funds, this seemed to be a big month for non-financial proposals
* which validate ideas, objectives, strategies and values.
* Big congrats to Rubben and Luc and the [Caribbean Blockchain Research Network](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xa3f5411cfc9eee0dd108bf0d07433b6dd99037f1/proposal/0x660e2bfc7e179677bd8c8b727a2751e55b9bd05a63750b4c698e28ddb5510a2f) for their Genesis Alpha co-funded event, “Innovation C”! This conference aimed to promote collaboration and innovation on the island on topics such as business, sustainability, community building, well-being, DAOs, Decentralization and AI. It gathered [over 100 people](https://www.facebook.com/pg/innovationcur/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2213381275577186), including the Prime Minister!

A few words about the Accountability Task Force “episode”

* You may have heard about the eventful happenings around a proposal by the ATF.
* Here’s a rundown of what happened: After having completed its first 2 month experiment, the ATF put up a proposal for a [50 ETH extension](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xa3f5411cfc9eee0dd108bf0d07433b6dd99037f1/proposal/0xbb3d71d10587f24f22ed60ee0ae7680aba46545e23fbdf20685a36acb4862ad3) of that experiment. This proposal was the first in the history of Genesis to meet heavy disagreement among reputation holders, leading to over a dozen majority flips, record engagement rates and a final vote of 22% for / 20% against. If you want to know more, check out this [reflection on the state of Genesis Alpha](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OY-zzP9C0eaKYTsdCBLNLkhrSYUA_T6i1IKiDMZCon4/edit#) by Kate Beecroft, which includes an analysis of what happened.
* The ATF decided to return the funds and make a [refocused proposal of 20 ETH](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xa3f5411cfc9eee0dd108bf0d07433b6dd99037f1/proposal/0xe9077c8c85acb6909b48b8ca3660886d6a556addd8127c228870d3ba8c4ab6ef), which integrated feedback such as differentiating activities types more.

Shaping Genesis Alpha’s future through non-financial proposals

Here are some themes that arose from non-financial proposals last month:  


* [How can a DAO reward good ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1smpw3WeGGz7tMPO6yHz1fSUc8VzKNAgZpwP9FCKmLL8/edit)? This question has triggered a lot of useful reflections and generated a series of proposal ideas to address this challenge, such as a [bounty process](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MCi-cwOUqTRbu9RFep0D0VI_ZXbJs41c/view) and [tagging system](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xa3f5411cfc9eee0dd108bf0d07433b6dd99037f1/proposal/0xbab5fa54d626077b7a448d269584b37b8f12d263e8f917420a3094b433db50d8) for keeping track of past idea proposals
* How much is too much reputation? An experiment of multiple proposals by Daniel Shavit.
* How can [DAOs share reputation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18GF3f130miEsaASw-TRCHR-qRtbL8y-UsfusV7pXuZg/edit#) with each other?

Proposals that are “stuck” & Flagged by ATF

* Holographic Consensus Visualization Lab needs help! Dmitry has delivered the first main piece of work, but he is struggling to find a person to help with a dynamic digitalization of [this document.](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3A75cfae46-f15c-4235-9cea-b328d740f9bf) If you can help, get in touch with @Dmitry \(Telegram\).
* Alchemy Identity feature \| handed off to another Dev team, but no response for receiving updates
* Bridge to Aragon \| waiting on progress, no update received
* Genesis Community Blog & Genesis Community reports \| lacking submissions for these bounties!

**Ongoing Bounty programs**  


[DAO Adoption leads bounty](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScoMHU2lphpsdvc4OI7zHpqHJEIfKxoToZKXY9-pd2mlW6FKA/viewform) \| [Genesis Community Blog](https://goo.gl/apB5sV) \|  [DAO Community Reports](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xa3f5411cfc9eee0dd108bf0d07433b6dd99037f1/proposal/0xe0cdaef63d0d64f78f8d268c5db172cd59801a324bd200888265e517b419e9cf) \| [Joining Weekly Pollinator Calls](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iXpu2qA3aZ7QcSDhxQdG5ciZdJ0oNHzaRTQlIGQKT7s/edit)  


**\# Observations & Reflections**  


* As is common when a group grows and becomes more complex, more energy seems to currently be going into how to organize proposals \(in Alchemy\) and work streams \(through working groups\)
* The engagement challenge on bounties persists. It is very sad, for instance, that the [research questionnaire](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xa3f5411cfc9eee0dd108bf0d07433b6dd99037f1/proposal/0x945e1ad03fac15967af8f9fc3d7b224020ca2b6239137f4704322f69c952ad12) that Algiras launched had to be cancelled, because it did not get enough submissions.
* In comparison to the months before, Genesis has begun to accumulate a lot of funds. Currently there seems to be inertia to spend them, or lack of clarity on what is most strategic for the group at this point.
