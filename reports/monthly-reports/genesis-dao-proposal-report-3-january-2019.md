**Highlights**

* After having passed a proposal to enable statements to appear on the Genesis landing page, we have passed our first “mission statement”: Genesis’ mission is to grow a collectively intelligent network of DAOs. More details here: goo.gl/R3rohP
* [The Tao of the DAO](https://thetaoofthedao.greaterthan.works/) is ready, a guide to setting up a DAO and decentralized proposal process with Alchemy
* The pollinators are starting to prepare for the launch of the next version of Alchemy and welcoming in more people. Working groups have formed to do this work, such as “Planning”, “Communications” and “Use Cases”.
* The ATF has launched its’ first [Hourglass proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xa3f5411cfc9eee0dd108bf0d07433b6dd99037f1/proposal/0x2096a3e7eea0cef886a27f0a9a92bdd337f4ea2fc05bc66f9a84a6075bb8ad29)

Resources developed for the community

Open Source Development

Genesis is starting to establish “norms”

* A proposal passed that suggests that proposals requesting more than 1 ETH shall be downvoted if the proposer is not identified \| [see details](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xa3f5411cfc9eee0dd108bf0d07433b6dd99037f1/proposal/0x103be3d6c66797b751890e5292e7683af7b669fc7ab704073c8f3174206400f6)
* The interest in developing a [notifications feature](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xa3f5411cfc9eee0dd108bf0d07433b6dd99037f1/proposal/0x961638e17b54088aeada5f8c45ee47e097bc1874c478230b4e0d7500b1be0da1) for Alchemy was confirmed with a “support” proposal
* The poll on “how much reputation is too much” didn’t receive a sufficient number of responses, but Daniel decided to use the guideline neverless and has set a precedent of no person having above 2 % reputation.
* In reaction to this, it has been proposed to [buy out people’s reputation](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xa3f5411cfc9eee0dd108bf0d07433b6dd99037f1/proposal/0x2d96a387bfebcce3af138d4422fdfb4e124ff7ee9f56e9d5e82516ed5ead0b3f) if it gets above that threshold, to reward the fact that they are giving it up.
* There are not the first norms that were passed in Genesis - a few months ago a proposal was voted to formalize principles of [mutual respect and responsibility](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ko6jNXh2YcxcUmYL_36ewoLox3uc9oqDL-v6oeZIfis/edit)

Proposals that are “stuck” & Flagged by ATF

* Bridge to Aragon \| almost complete, waiting on documentation
