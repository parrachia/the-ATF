# Coordinated response  to the comments against the 1st ATF renewal proposal

[\[proposal on alchemy\]](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xa3f5411cfc9eee0dd108bf0d07433b6dd99037f1/proposal/0xbb3d71d10587f24f22ed60ee0ae7680aba46545e23fbdf20685a36acb4862ad3)

[\[proposal document\]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TlnbJ4mgptsl6YuTdt4X5m0MUI8XD_fCGphT8k7zU5o/edit)

#### Why are we coordinating a formal response to these comments and not taking them as healthy disagreement?

* massive downvoting mere hours before expiration
* absolutely no opposition within weeks of public discussion on multiple channels
* prior discussion of role overlap between DAOstack staff and ATF with core team

#### Main arguments against:

1. too much ETH
2. too much from the budget for the period \(25%\)
3. “police state”
4. already partially paid by DAOstack

We believe there has been a misunderstanding of some key pieces of information, which we wish to clarify here.

#### Initial answers to these arguments:

1. ETH/USD fell more than 50% since the 1st ATF proposal
2. While ETH price fell 50%, the budget remained the same
   1. 25% sounds a lot, but what about 12,5%? Without the ETH price drop \(or with a proporcional correction\) we'd be asking for mere 12,5% of this budget
   2. this proposal was made in light of a very ambitious goal, which is having the Genesis DAO ready for a public launch in a manner that does not carry too large risks \(like proposers running away with funds without delivering\). Preparing this will be a lot of work and a large proportion is one-time setup/automation work, not maintenance.
   3. the budget was not calculated based on the % of the monthly DAO budget, but time estimates and reasonable hourly rates. Paying ourselves decently for our work has been one of the principles in Genesis DAO from the beginning
3. We don’t believe the atf deserves to be called a « police state » entity for the following reasons :
   1. such statement could make sense coming from an outsider. but during the 2 months of the 1st experiment we continuously, strongly, dismantled any possibility of any authoritarian action.
   2. the biggest goal of the proposal is to make the ATF itself obsolete, so that this will be the 2nd and last ATF experiment
4. After conversations with a member of the DAOstack team, it was agreed that it would be “cleaner” for the ATF budget to be fully funded through Genesis, rather than have it match funded through DAOstack \(which was also discussed\). The objective was to run this as its own sub-budget, which will only be spent when work is done \(so funds that are not used are returned\). The hours already paid for the accountability work by DAOstack will be deducted from this \(i.e. the work will not be paid for twice\)

Im concerned too

Its an extensive and impressive proposal, and an exiting project!

BUT:

1. 25% of the Genesis budget for the next 2 months just for the ATF seems unproportional.

2. DAOstack Technologies is already directly financing Proposal monitoring work. it is unclear if the two projects are overlapping or have merged and if they did what part of the proposed scope is covered by which budget?

3. It is unclear to me why individuals doing work directly for DAOstack Tech can not be part of the team. also it is not the case at the moment since at least one of the team members is working for the company.  


I can not support this until the above matters are clarified

I agree with Adam. 2 month = 9 weeks ==&gt; 225 ETH budget. 50 ETH is 22.2% of it, which is quite a "police state" if this is the police budget. In other words, when budget is low there is less to police about, and thus less budget needed for policing. I'd suggest that 10% police budget sounds legitimate. In that case it'd be around the 25 ETH \(upward rounded\). Bottom line:  


- I've downvoted

- suggesting to re-propose with a budget up to 25 ETH

- in any ways this discussion is really good and important and we should have more of them

Just to explain.

This is 25% of the DAO budget, just for the ATF, it makes no sense at all.  
  


Nave • 4 hours ago

I agree with Adam. 50 ETH for 2 months is 25% of the DAO's entire budget. Seems disproportionate and I'm not convinced on the justification.

50 ETH sounds way too much for this proposal.
