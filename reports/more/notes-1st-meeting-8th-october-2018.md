# Notes 1st Meeting - 8th October 2018

Present: Francesca Pick, Patrick Rawson, Dmitry Narozhny and ATF members Pedro Parrachia, Jùlio Monteiro, Daniel Shavit

Francesca: Will act as coordinator between ATF and DAOstack team.  
What is the role of DAOstack with respect to the ATF? Will not be stepping in and managing but is there for support and information.

Daniel: Need to understand the timeline and KPIs to set the agenda and priorities of the ATF.

* The ATF was presented with critical milestones such as new members and funding coming in.

Pat:Need to have accountability for proposals

* Different attention and punishment for different gravity of breaches
* Aspects of both accountability and defensibility
* Understand and prepare as the Genesis Alpha becomes some an undeniable honeypot

Pedro, Julio: start with manual steps to get acquainted with the process and then automate it.  
Introduce a new “certification” or “review” process, try to understand what is good or bad. Start using Trello again.  
We must define out methodology, Pedro is planning on rolling out a preliminary study on this. Must look at methodology of other similar projects \(examples: Aragon, Colony\)

Francesca: Priority is to define penalties for non execution.

Pedro: Having a critical distance not to enforce or approve things as the ATF but should be a recommendation and flagging of diligence points outside the curve for the community. The ATF must have no special authority and should avoid be antagonised and antagonising as much as possible.

The objective is surfacing bad \(and good!\) behaviors, not being jury, judge much less executioner

Daniel: Defining a calendar/deliverables in the context of a relatively autonomous initiative.

ATF members chat: A goal for the first week: proof of concepts. defining the framework for signalling and processing of accounting/attack claims manually, then in the medium/ long run automate procedures that work. Re-activating Trello for reporting and tracking of proposals.

Dmitry: the role of ATF is to incentivize community attention on proposals. Even incentivising the community to perform some of this diligence work, involve everyone in the process via incentives. This will help define best practices while involving the wider community. What does the community think about the direction and execution of proposals?

Jùlio: As soon as the procedures are ready tracking and monitoring will become more intuitive.

Francesca:Automation can be very useful as there’s a lot of manual work that grows exponentially with number of members.

Jùlio: Start writing a draft about accountability, to accompany the defense protocol document. From next week can come with a draft internally reviewed.

Pedro:  
Weekly meetings at this beginning and see how things roll  
Some level of systematic review and meta analysis are a must to avoid reinventing the wheel and save precious energy.  
Could use [CollectiveOne](http://www.collectiveone.org) as our main tool.

Daniel: Start an internal Telegram group to move quickly and coordinate so as to not spam the Discord channel with small details and logistics, it will be reserved to important communications.
