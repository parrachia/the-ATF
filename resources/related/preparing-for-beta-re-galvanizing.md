# Preparing for Beta: Re-galvanizing

[By Kate Beecroft 28 December 2018](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OY-zzP9C0eaKYTsdCBLNLkhrSYUA_T6i1IKiDMZCon4/edit#)

The purpose of this document is to present a brief analysis of the life cycle of the Genesis Alpha  from my unique vantage point as community facilitator of the Genesis Alpha and as part of the Ecosystem team of DAOstack. It draws on my experience as a member of various ‘decentralized and participatory’ communities and from consulting on community formation and self management in several organisations. It addresses where \(from my own perspective\) we are at and where I see critical points for resetting in order to prepare for the Beta and move away from the inertia, apathy and discontent we are currently experiencing. It outlines potential action points and invites action based discourse and dialogue.

Note: this is pretty direct analysis, however it does not place the blame of the current ‘cycle’ at anyone’s feet - the Genesis Alpha is a collective effort and a very complex project and no on person in particular can be or feel responsible in the life cycles of a community \(I include myself in this, even though I feel responsible for some of these areas\)

## Analysis

The Genesis Alpha DAO is an experiment and with any experiment it’s important to reflect on aims and hypotheses and examine findings.

The Genesis DAO has been through several stages; firstly we saw excitement, mainly due to feelings of relevance and self-identification as pioneering new possibilities, this resulted in a lot of action, energy and [many proposals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FV8iz4ebZb4E3nXckzPsWy7IfhtsX3filkbX_gbPLNs/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102397445352980551692). Ten months in we are entering a period of apathy and inaction. We can see inertia forming - there are 141 ETH unspent and in the last month the amount of proposals being submitted have dropped substantially.

These are symptoms that are perhaps not unexpected within community forming cycles \([see stages of group development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development)\) and are also reinforced by some of the following factors.

### **The ATF scenario**

The ATF voting episode has proven to be an important milestone in the life of the Genesis Alpha DAO. Some of the positive effects are that it proved to galvanise the community around an important issue, it sparked more engagement from the DAOstack leadership and it helped catalise a more indepth proposal process and clarification of deliverables.

Some of the negative effects are that it helped cause apathy in many previously very activated pollinators, primarily because it was experienced as an exercise in top down authority and mistrust.

When something really intense happens, which takes a lot of the collective attention \(like the ATF\), it's almost like the attention credit of the community is depleted. Often activity drops significantly afterwards, not just because of apathy, but due to fatigue and needing some pause. Communities function in a sort of ebb and flow of activity, and that sometimes when there is an ebb, it seems like the community is dying, but actually it is just another step in the cycle before the flow comes back.

The ATF episode though, also contributed to the polarisation of the group and to factions forming - according to discourse and feedback \(collected in the following weeks of the ‘episode’\) on the subject there is a ‘inner circle’ of old standing Pollinators \(a very common dynamic in communities\) and another group - those reacting against them. This is in turn transferring into the communications problems outlined in the section below.

### **Genesis Alpha &lt;&gt; DAOstack relationship**

The relationship between Genesis Alpha and DAOstack Technologies is tense. This is not limited to the following factors:

* Lack of perceived interest in the Genesis Alpha from DAOstack leaders and intermittent presence in the Genesis Alpha community while still retaining large amounts of reputation and soft power
* Dropping in to share knowledge ‘from the top or ‘as the authority’
* Perceived ‘overlord’ effect taking away agency from the community - \(wrongly or rightly seen in the aftermath of the ATF episode\)
* Lack of clarity about the role and mandate of people who work for DAOstack versus those who are pure Pollinators.

This unclear relationship has played a significant part in feelings of apathy that are emerging in Super Active Pollinators.

\(I also acknowledge fully the role my facilitation of group calls has played in the emergence of this dynamic - i.e. inviting DAOstack leaders to drop in and announce certain things\)

Meta-level components of community formation

We have a case of the [Tyranny of Structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm) which is backed up and even entrenched by the so-called ideological aversion to coordination held by many or the more politicised Pollinators and the still unproven attachment to the ‘hive mind’ being developed enough to ‘swarm’ on right action in every scenario. Perhaps this happens at the protocol level, but we’re still a great distance away from being able to practise ‘emergent’ decision making \(defined as: everyone makes decisions individually, and the overall direction arises from the combination of all of those e.g voting in elections, contributing to open source software\) and group cohesion at the soft governance layer \(if this is actually possible\). Many groups who have been practising participatory organising for many years still cannot practise emergent decision making and organization all of the time, and for valid reasons, choose not to.

### **From the Tyranny of structureless article’**

a great emphasis has been placed on what are called leaderless, structureless groups as the main -- if not sole -- organizational form of the movement’... People would try to use the "structureless" group and the informal conference for purposes for which they were unsuitable out of a blind belief that no other means could possibly be anything but oppressive. If the movement is to grow beyond these elementary stages of development, it will have to disabuse itself of some of its prejudices about organization and structure. There is nothing inherently bad about either of these. They can be and often are misused, but to reject them out of hand because they are misused is to deny ourselves the necessary tools to further development. We need to understand why "structurelessness" does not work.

Within the theory of ‘self management’ it is a practise to be able to move between different components of ‘management’ including but not limited to; collaborative, emergent, dictatorial, delegated, decentralized as articulated in t[his blog about types of decision making](https://medium.com/@alannallama/9-decision-types-you-should-know-3311f2621e04). The idea of ‘moving between between forms of organization depending on the situation, reflects thinking from Spiral Dynamics and the notion of ‘Teal’ - we don’t arrive at an enlightened state and stay there, and thinking to do so is to soundly disprove our understanding of what Teal is.

‘Life is a process of becoming, a process of a combination of states we have to go through. Where people fail is that they wish to elect a kind of state and stay in it. This is a kind of death. Anais Nin.

Our relative experience as community and ideological attachment to one form of organizing means we are not able to move between different forms of organization.

### **Communication tensions**

In the Genesis Alpha, small factions are forming and what might be conceived of as ‘ego fighting’ \(or compulsive talking from one perspective\)  is starting to occur \(with more frequency\). I take the view that the majority of communication is an attempt to be seen, heard, and \(dear I say it\) loved. When times are tough and unclarity exists, the volume tends to go up and the ability for us to hear and see others goes down. \(Note: the so-called ego fighting is not so dominant as to be problematic but it is starting and is at the stage where we can prevent it escalating.\)

This is not unexpected. In my personal opinion the Genesis Alpha Pollinator community are largely typified by extremely smart, competent agents, many of whom are experts or pioneers in some way.  Furthermore \(and again drawing on my own experience\), people from a younger generation \(particularly those who have the independence of web developers in the blockchain space\) are more likely to be ‘pirates or rebels and reject the top down hierarchies that society has typically been ordered by. This means they’re more likely to survive and thrive in new systems of organization \(like DAOs\), However, this openness for change does not necessarily mean such actors are prepared for the changes that must occur \(internally and externally\) when operating in a form of new organisation. These characteristics of typical DAO early adopters means that there is a [strong individualistic streak](https://medium.com/@jillcarlson/free-company-49b129461b3c) which doesn’t prime us for deep collaboration or community ‘norming’.

We’re trying to build a new system and it is not enough to merely hope the tech will save us. We all need to reflect on how our behaviours impact our ability to collaborate and get stuff done that will make it possible for others to join this new system and then they can collaborate to build the infrastructure so that others can join, and so on. This is important, noone is Switzerland - we’re all complicit in the creation of culture and communication patterns. Everyone is always ready to call someone else a troll without considering how they are part of the behavior that drives polarisation and conflict.

‘Everyone holds a part of the truth and no one holds the whole truth.’ Amy Edmondson, Teaming.

### **Crypto-winter**

There’s no ignoring that the reliance on an extremely volatile means of value has impacted the Genesis Alpha significantly. We need to take this into consideration as we act, plan and continue to build the DAO and the DAO ecosystem.

[Here are some stats on engagement](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G9cTHFjhu6FdCBazgp9KS4UzB9g5262fZCchujJdHhk/edit#gid=0)

* 25 Super Active Pollinators
* 150 or so ‘onboarded’ Pollinators

These views are my own. Agree, contest, add and/or write your own :\)

## Where to from Here

Based on the above analysis and problem areas I have identified the following areas for getting back on track... Or creating a track.

### Getting to clarity

Due to a culmination of factors, there is no clear direction in Genesis Alpha apart from a general feeling that it would be good if there were ‘more DAOs’ and we are successful if we have more active Pollinators. The initial goals were: test alchemy alpha and pave the ground for a DAO to which DAOstack/Alchemy would migrate to - in and of themselves these were also too murky and were not co-created - which is a major reason objectives in participatory organisations do not stick. Some perceive this limited direction as good, in that every actor can hold their own direction and the general direction of the DAO derives from that.  


However, in this early stage of the experiment and of the nascent ecosystem, attempting to move to an easily identifiable objective is not a bad thing -it will provide the much missed clarity that the Genesis Alpha lacks. Furthermore, I don’t think that this ‘objective’ should be provided by DAOstack - the best objective is co-created and agreed upon by the group itself.

Objective setting

For the Genesis Alpha to develop towards a successful Beta launch and iteration it is recommended that a collectively held, clearly quantifiable objective is set.  


Possible action points:

* Restart the Planning Group with a specific aim and intention
* Hold a call \(early Jan\)
* Hold a collaborative/delegated process to determine an objective.
* Submit this proposal on Alchemy. Transfer to the ‘heading’ box. Work started here.

Communication channels review

The communication channels utilised by Genesis Alpha have long proven to be a problem. Telegram does not have the functionality to fully serve a community. Discord has severe barriers to entry, ease of use, features and functionality and we have very limited use and uptake.  


Possible action points:

* Discuss needs
* Identify a working group of people who care and who have knowledge
* Identify solutions
* Propose and submit options \(that take into account the scale we shall soon see\)

Possible action points:

### Open Source Development

Lack of coherence about what is being built and what is the priority from DAOstack. Lack of clarity in the Pollinator community about what we want to build and why - this relates to overall lack of clarity.  


Possible action points:

* Do a retrospective about how we’ve worked on dev
* Kick of the Open Source working group - create a Genesis Alpha roadmap
* Recruit developers based on their ability to build some of these features
* Caltify bounty schemes  

### Crypto-economic Research \(for Genesis Alpha\)

There is so much research happening but we haven’t harnessed it to serve our need and the DAOstack Research group has failed to materialise action and follow through with bounties. One solution might be for Adam and Matan to identify all the key areas that urgently need research - and then hand over the bounty system to a working group to coordinate around. Such people already exist and want to do the work and the inertia around this mean that DAOstack may be losing valuable people and minds to competing areas.

### Building the DAO ecosystem

There is a lack of clarity on the different use cases and what different use cases need to begin. There is an assumption that we’re ready to ‘scale’ without focus or effort clarifying the MVPS and value provided or on the needs of the different use cases.  


Start with:

Identifying UVPs  


Use case Mapping  


Possible action points:

* Start or reinvigorate a DAO talk for MVP discussion and Use Case Mapping
* Create a framework or canvas
* Based on criteria uncovered in MVP and Use Case mapping carry out a number of customer interviews

### Questioning the Model

We are operating as a loosely coupled, networked, collective type DAO where agents pitch for pieces of the budget to execute work and this has largely been unquestioned. We could consider other options in pursuit of our objective. The question is ‘what use case or formation best serves us to meet our objective’.  


Some ideas have been: start operating as a ‘firm or agency’ type DAO where Active Members are akin to employees and receive a portion of ETH each month and are expected to deliver.
