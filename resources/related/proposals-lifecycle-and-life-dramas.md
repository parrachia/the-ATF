# Proposals Lifecycle & Life Dramas

[Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CEDzNwHkEoTz3LiPZ45Ntrl4JFykVOut0mfirfz85eA/edit#)

The objectives here are to:

* offer some very basic propositions
* use those propositions as starting point to outline major challenges
* very briefly describe possible solutions
* have all the previous steps open for discussion, improvement, incrementation
* and most importantly, validate them on Alchemy

## Basic Validation - Lifecycle Stages

Super simple list with the most basic stages, split between pre and post award/funding.

Should be a no brainer but it’s the foundation for all the next steps, so I’d really like to polish it.  


1. Pre Award
   1. Pre Proposal
   2. Voting
2. Post Award
   1. WIP
   2. Deliverables
   3. Arbitration

## Further Validation - Lifecycle Steps

Here come some moving parts, a breaking down of each stage into steps. This is a bit more open ended and I’m super curious about your feedback.  


1. Pre Award
   1. Pre Proposal
      1. Instrumentalization
      2. Proposal writing
      3. Pitch
      4. Feedback
   2. Voting
      1. Campaigning
      2. Alchemy
2. Post Award
   1. WIP
      1. Updates
   2. Deliverables
      1. Evaluation
      2. Documentation
   3. Arbitration
      1. Localized
      2. Community-wide
      3. Exotic

Does is make sense, am I missing something, should I use different words somewhere?  


## Life Dramas

Here’s the fun part! Major pains / issues per step.

My hope here is that we evolve this list until we bring in to light root problems of each step

1. **Pre Award**
   1. Pre Proposal
      1. Instrumentalization
         1. How proposers can get up to speed on latest agreements, Metamask debugging or relevant goals?
      2. Proposal writing
         1. It’s not easy to write a good proposal and sometimes great ideas don’t pass because poor presentation \(and vice and versa\)
         2. How one does accept/propose the terms to be held accountable?
      3. Pitch
         1. Should it be "mandatory" for a proposer to ask for feedback before submitting? I don't think so, but then what are the implications \(on exploitability for example\)
      4. Feedbacks
         1. Small mistakes like asking for too much or too little reputation, having a great idea but poor presentation are costly and can be easily avoided here. But how to incentive proposers to ask for and the community to give it?
   2. Voting
      1. Campaigning
         1. Where is the line between perseverance and being pushy, defining fairplay
      2. Alchemy
         1. Dapp usability and troubleshooting
2. **Post Award**
   1. WIP
      1. Updates
         1. Accountability
   2. Deliverables
      1. Evaluation
         1. Should we pipeline this process? Seems like the most important and yet the most unclear.
      2. Documentation
         1. At best it’s been a mess, with unaccounted redundancies and never a complete repository of all things about Alchemy and Genesis Alpha. How can we improve on that?
   3. Arbitration
      1. 1. How do we want to solve conflicts / reassess and stabilize the holographic consensus?
      2. Localized
         1. There and then, agile, fast tracked
      3. Community-wide
         1. public, transparent, accountable
      4. Exotic
         1. The ATF
         2. External
         3. Legal
         4. Other

## And Finally, our Problems and Solutions Proposition

A straight list with initial pains and issues listed and some half baked solutions

### Initial Issues

Pre Award

1. How proposers can get up to speed on latest agreements, Metamask debugging or relevant goals?
2. It’s not easy to write a good proposal and sometimes great ideas don’t pass because poor presentation \(and vice and versa\)
3. How one does accept/propose the terms to be held accountable?
4. Should it be "mandatory" for a proposer to ask for feedback before submitting? I don't think so, but then what are the implications \(on exploitability for example\)
5. Small mistakes like asking for too much or too little reputation, having a great idea but poor presentation are costly and can be easily avoided here. But how to incentive proposers to ask for and the community to give it?
6. Where is the line between perseverance and being pushy, defining fairplay
7. Dapp procedures, best practices, tech support and the stuff: documentation \(again\)

Post Award

1. Accountability
2. Should we pipeline the evaluation process step? Seems like the most important and yet the most unclear.
3. At best it’s been a mess, with unaccounted redundancies and never a complete repository of all things about Alchemy and Genesis Alpha. How can we improve on that?
4. How do we want to solve conflicts / reassess and stabilize the holographic consensus

### Possible Solutions

_Twitter style - presented in 280-ish characters or less_  


**Pre Award**

* How proposers can get up to speed on latest agreements, Metamask debugging or relevant goals?

Scaffolding.

List all need to know intel & come up with ways to make sure every proposer have access to it \(especially newcomers\)  


* It’s not easy to write a good proposal and sometimes great ideas don’t pass because of poor presentation \(and vice and versa\)

Before writing, implementing scaffolding practices can help a lot. After writing, looking around for feedback really helps too. But the process of writing itself has been poorly supported so far.

We can build guides and templates but incentives for "writing angels" should nail it  


* How one does accept/propose the terms to be held accountable?

Accountability should be distributed and the ATF’s biggest goal should be to make itself OBSOLETE.

The proposer should choose how they are to be held accountable beforehand. Appointing auditors, Self certification, Invoking the ATF..  like optin accountability profiles and/or optout basic accountability agreement  


* Should it be "mandatory" for a proposer to ask for feedback before submitting? I don't think so, but then what are the implications \(on exploitability for example\)

?  


* Small mistakes like asking for too much or too little reputation, having a great idea but poor presentation are costly and can be easily avoided here. But how to incentive proposers to ask for and the community to give it?

A similar situation to nº2. Maybe, here we could go for a new, rotating, role among us.

Some people could submit proposals, to actively look for ways to engage the right people for their feedback, proposal per proposal. Like a Liquid Democracy beacon  
  


* Where is the line between perseverance and being pushy, defining fairplay

Well, we gotta define what’s fairplay here.

What about Staking and Boosting?

Should we suggest what to look for in a proposal when voting?

IMHO opinion yes:

1st - Risk assessment

2nd- Goals alignment

3rd - Presentation

What if great ideas don’t get their proposals passed?  
  


* Dapp usability and troubleshooting

\[WIP\]  


**Post Award**

* Accountability

The ATF gotta come up with the groundwork to empower the community’s autonomy to hold itself accountable.

Solutions so far include:

 manual active proposals tracking

 automated proposals tracking

 certification & flagging

the optin accountability profiles and  
 custom tailored arbitration templates  


* Should we pipeline the evaluation process step? Seems like the most important and yet the most unclear.

\(how to track a calendar of all proposals\) if the all clear isn't naturally obvious, auditors are called in. Those auditors can be anyone, the ATF or even people appointed in the proposal itself.

if after a super quick investigation and conciliation attempt a reasonable outcome isn't achieved \(how to measure that?\), than a full, formal arbitration process should begin.  
  


* At best it’s been a mess, with unaccounted redundancies and never a complete repository of all things about Alchemy and Genesis Alpha. How can we improve on that?

The initial proposal document should have links to all subsequent documents and deliverables \(like a merkle tree\)

We need to come up with a way to aggregate all docs and stuff like the [\[doc and state proposal\]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CEDzNwHkEoTz3LiPZ45Ntrl4JFykVOut0mfirfz85eA/edit#)  
  


* How do we want to solve conflicts / reassess and stabilize the holographic consensus

\[WIP\]  


Late

"Localized Arbitration" after X condition  


Bad quality / different than promised

"Exotic Arbitration"  


No deliver

Community-wide Arbitration

Fostering / Rep loss / Offboarding  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**To do \(hopefully collectively\):**For a Cooperative Problem & Solution Proposition

- add more issues and solutions

- filter/validate them all

- prioritize / add weighting system

- in depth description in another document

- call to action

- at least a couple proposals out of this mess

- review of the entire process
