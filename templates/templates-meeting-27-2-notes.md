# Templates meeting 27/2 notes

1 - We'd like to use gitbook + github for documenting, but we'll stick with gDocs for the time being.

2 - We'd like to improve the process for the final proposal document \(automation?\), like having a form which would output a proposal document  
 - maybe [Team Drives](https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/drive/get-started-team-drive/#!/) in the short term future

3 - We decided to split proposals into:

Nonfinancial Proposals  
[- Nonfinancial Proposals Types](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VTwI_FVDUfUY9YtJOII4QWOR3fFx1EZOT443eMyG7qI/edit#)

Financial Proposal  
- [One-time](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nhr3D-uRGcxPZ6_WwHbDkdJD-twNzxRhKWOTJgfnVdA/edit?usp=sharing)   
- [Recurring ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_htpkwx0z-7PeGCf5vF-aBXM7OqW7QzV31cuk2oDyZk/edit)

3 - References  
- [Late stage Onboarding - the Cookbook](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r6wHBo8-MXb8m8ef-ZACaP4_mf9tiuj0xfEAFEnKlbI/edit?usp=sharing)  
- [Trello board with tasks \(from kate\)](https://trello.com/b/pirBAjCN/gendao-tasks)

6 - How should we structure the templates themselves?
